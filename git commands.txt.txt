Hey all, 
I hope this makes things easier. You can make push requests directly on the site I think
or you can make them from the command line. 

1. Make a github account 
2. Try making a folder on your desktop (can be any name)
3. access your folder from your command line. (mac and PC commands are different)
4. You can still use IDLE or use whatever IDE you want. 
5. I'm using windows for this project so the following looks like this for me. 
	
PS C:\Users\Trevor\Desktop\project\project2020>

Now type the following and hit enter after each line. 
git init
git config --global user.name "username" (your git hub username)
git config --global user.email sample@mail.com (your github email you used to make your account)

*****Mine looks like this after its done****
PS C:\Users\Trevor\Desktop\project\project2020> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Trevor/Desktop/project/project2020/.git/
PS C:\Users\Trevor\Desktop\project\project2020> git config --global user.name "tlongmir"
PS C:\Users\Trevor\Desktop\project\project2020> git config --global user.email dpione@live.com

Now that you have your git file setup within your project folder, github knows your global username and 
email so now you can start adding and pulling from github.

copy and paste this into your command line in the same directory you just made 

This line will copy the whole project that I have, after you hit enter, you should see 
the edit.py and main.py files in your folder. 

git clone https://github.com/tlongmir/project2020.git


This line will pull any changes made and refresh your edit.py and main.py files
git pull https://github.com/tlongmir/project2020.git
